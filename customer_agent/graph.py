"""Customer Agent LangGraph definition.

Uses create_react_agent with a `delegate_to_legal_agent` tool that:
1. Discovers the Law Agent via the registry
2. Sends the question to it via A2A
3. Returns the comprehensive legal response to the user

The tool accepts context propagation data (trace_id, context_id, depth)
via a closure — these are bound per-request in agent_executor.py.

legal services platform. Your job is to:

1. Understand the user's legal question
2. Determine if it needs specialist legal analysis (contract issues, tax law,

3. If so, use the `delegate_to_legal_agent` tool to send it to the Law Agent,
   which will coordinate specialist sub-agents (Tax and Compliance) as needed
4. Present the comprehensive response clearly to the user

Always use the `delegate_to_legal_agent` tool for any substantive legal question.
Do not attempt to answer complex legal questions from your own knowledge alone.

Be professional, clear, and make the specialist response accessible to the user.
Communicate and provide the final results to users in Vietnamese.
